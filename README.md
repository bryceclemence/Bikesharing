# Bikesharing


### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to get an understanding od using Tableau by vizualizing Citibike data to detertmine if a similar bikesharing project would 
work in Des Moines. The charts are used to create a presentation to show to invenstors to help better understand if a program would work in a much different city.

The above two graphs show the number of bikes checked-out and how long they were ridden, in total and broken down by gender.
From this data we can see that the majority of users were male, and that most of the bikes were needed for 5 minutes. After the 5 minute mark check-out times drop dramatically. This could be problematic when introducing a bikesharing program in cities nnot as densely populated or big as New York, as other cities are more spread out. However, this program could be effective in sections of cities where it does have a high population and is more compact.

Above are the top starting and ending locations for users of Citibike. From this data it seems that most users start and end their ride within a pretty close radius.
This shows that the bikesharing program is very useful in New York, as it seems like an increasingly effective way way to get around town without having to take the subway, a cab, or walk.
