# Bikesharing


### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to get an understanding od using Tableau by vizualizing Citibike data to detertmine if a similar bikesharing project would 
work in Des Moines. The charts are used to create a presentation to show to invenstors to help better understand if a program would work in a much different city.

The above two graphs show the number of bikes checked-out and how long they were ridden, in total and broken down by gender.
From this data we can see that the majority of users were male, and that most of the bikes were needed for 5 minutes. After the 5 minute mark check-out times drop dramatically. This could be problematic when introducing a bikesharing program in cities nnot as densely populated or big as New York, as other cities are more spread out. However, this program could be effective in sections of cities where it does have a high population and is more compact.

These two heatmaps show when usage was the highest. It seems that during rush hours 6-9am and 4-7pm is when activity was the highest, with both male and female usage being aligned. This makes sense in a city like New York since like the rest of the world, people are trying to get to work and are finding an alternative way to get around without having to take the subway, buy a cab, or walk.

This graphic shows the usage by gnder on each day. It seems that the users mostly needed to get around on weekdays, with Thursday and Friday being the highest needed days, and Sunday and Wedneday were the lowest days people used Citibike.

Above are the top starting and ending locations for users of Citibike. From this data it seems that most users start and end their ride within a pretty close radius.
This shows that the bikesharing program is very useful in New York, as it seems like an increasingly effective way way to get around town without having to take the subway, a cab, or walk.


### Summary
In conclusion it seems like a bikesharing program would be highly beneficial to any well populated area. It is obviously working well in New York and it is a great alternative and environmentally friendly way to get around.
For additional visualizations I would include data to show exact distance users were riding, because I believe this would change drasically when comparing data to New York, and I would also include a visualization to see what users were using Citibike for, whether it be their usual means of transportation, they used it specifically to get to work, or they are just going on a bike ride. This would be effective when comparing other people's lifestyles in another city.
